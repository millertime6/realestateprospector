An app that allows Realtors to plan for and calculate the number of deals needed to reach their sales goals

The Real Estate Sales Prospector is an app built in pure vanilla JavaScript that allows Realtors to plan and calculate their sales goals. I started by declaring the variables needed to collect the inputs from the user (an agent or his or her manager), then after receiving the right amount of info, it places the results at the bottom of the page.
